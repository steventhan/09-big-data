    <h2>Big Data: geoJSON</h2>
    <h3>The goal for this assignment is to simulate a data set that you may
      encounter during project week!</h3>
      <h3>Let's focus only on transforming this collection. No need to
        invoke a constructor, or pass off control to Handlebars.</h3>
        <h3>Start simple:
          <p>
            1. Transform the initial collection into
              and array of each object's properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Next, try combining that
              new collection with some other valuable info such as the coordinates
              for each zip.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Also remove redundancies like the county, borough, city and state since we
              already know the context, as our app would theoretically show, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. For the zips where we have two or more neighborhoods, let's
              eliminate all but the first one ("Greenwich Village, SoHo"
              becomes "Greenwich Village").
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Populate an array of the five 'densest' neighborhoods based on
              zip occurrences.
          </p>
